## 📖 What are Agent Skills?

> **Agent Skills** are a lightweight, open format for extending AI agents with specialized knowledge and workflows. At its core, a skill is a **folder containing a `SKILL.md` file** — metadata (`name`, `description`) plus instructions that tell an agent *how* to perform a task. Skills may also bundle `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`.

This collection follows the [Anthropic Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io/specification): each skill is **self-contained, version-controlled, and loaded on demand** through *progressive disclosure*.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Discovery<br/>Agent 启动时仅加载<br/>name + description] --> B[Activation<br/>任务匹配 description →<br/>读取完整 SKILL.md]
    B --> C[Execution<br/>按指令执行 ·<br/>按需调用 scripts / references]
```

Because full instructions load **only when a task calls for them**, an agent can keep many skills on hand with a tiny context footprint — exactly the design the spec intends.

---

## ✨ Why this collection

| | This repo | Naïve "prompt dumps" |
|---|-----------|----------------------|
| **Structure** | Spec-compliant folders (`SKILL.md` + `scripts/` + `references/`) | Loose `.md` files |
| **Loading model** | Progressive disclosure (metadata → body → resources) | Everything dumped into context |
| **Provenance** | Every skill built via a benchmarked 4-step loop | Ad-hoc |
| **Benchmarked against** | Official Anthropic whitepaper + `agentskills.io` + mature skills (`dbs-content`, `yao-demand-skill`) | — |
| **License** | MIT, explicit `license`/`allowed-tools` frontmatter | Unspecified |
| **Tested** | Scripts runnable; JSON-validated outputs | Untested |

In short: these are **workflow + experience-distillation** skills (the Anthropic / OpenAI sense), not code generators.

### 1. 🔍 `long-screenshot-ocr` — Ultra-long screenshot OCR

- **What it does**: Splits a tall screenshot into overlapping slices, upscales each, runs RapidOCR (PP-OCR), rebuilds reading order, and cleans noise (page numbers, console timestamps, edge artifacts). Solves whole-image OCR's missing titles, scrambled order, and digit noise.
- **Dependencies**: `pip install rapidocr-onnxruntime pillow numpy`
- **Usage**:
  ```bash
  python skills/long-screenshot-ocr/scripts/ocr_long_screenshot.py <image.png> <output.md>
  ```
- **Inside**: `SKILL.md`, `scripts/ocr_long_screenshot.py`

### 2. 💬 `miniprogram-builder` — WeChat mini-program, zero to one

- **What it does**: A workflow + experience-decision cards. Turns a vague idea into a shippable WeChat mini-program: topic decision (5 cards A–E) → filing/entity/category selection → optional skeleton generation → launch runbook. Bundles a distilled "AI Mini-Program Field Manual" + WeChat service-category table.
- **Dependencies**: optional `scripts/generate_miniprogram.py` needs Python 3 (generates valid skeletons: calculator / score / quiz / generator / custom).
- **Usage**: invoke the skill in chat, advance through Phases 0–7; run the generator when a skeleton is needed.
- **Inside**: `SKILL.md`, `references/manual_synthesis.md`, `references/wechat_service_categories.md`, `scripts/generate_miniprogram.py`, `_demo/` (generated samples)

### 3. 📐 `skill-building-playbook` — Meta-skill for authoring skills

- **What it does**: Codifies *how to build a good skill* into a reusable loop — `skill-creator` scaffold → scrape/search distillation → benchmark local mature skills (`dbs-content`, `yao-demand-skill`) → validate against the official Anthropic spec. The methodology this whole repo is built on.
- **Dependencies**: none (pure methodology + references).
- **Usage**: invoke in chat; deep spec in `references/agent-skills-official-spec.md`.
- **Inside**: `SKILL.md`, `references/agent-skills-official-spec.md`

### 4. 🖼️ `gzh-cover-maker` — WeChat cover image generator

- **What it does**: Turns an article hook into two ready-to-use PNGs — **1080×1080 square** (feed thumbnail) + **1080×460 wide** (article top / share card). Premium dark + gold palette, large numeric/keyword anchor, 5-element task chips.
- **Dependencies**: `pip install pillow` + a Chinese system font (Microsoft YaHei / Source Han Sans).
- **Usage**: invoke the skill in chat; scripts in `scripts/`.
- **Inside**: `SKILL.md`, `scripts/gzh_cover.py`, `scripts/gzh_cover_膝盖篇.py`

### 5. 📊 `gzh-infographic-maker` — WeChat comparison infographic

- **What it does**: Generates 1080px-wide two-column comparison infographics. Restrained, premium look: near-black ink + warm gold + muted red (for the "before" side), rounded cards, bottom summary bar. Avoids font-glyph check/cross markers.
- **Dependencies**: `pip install pillow` + Chinese font.
- **Usage**: invoke the skill in chat; script in `scripts/gzh_infographic.py`.
- **Inside**: `SKILL.md`, `scripts/gzh_infographic.py`

### 6. 🧠 `repo-topic-pipeline` — Repo → topic library → decision table

- **What it does**: Converts any GitHub repo (or local docs/code folder) into a structured, searchable material library, then runs a 4-stage pipeline → ranked topic decision table: ① Collect ② Mine (multi-angle) ③ Score (5 dimensions, local tool) ④ Classify (Markdown + CSV).
- **Dependencies**: Python 3 (transparent local scoring tool).
- **Usage**: invoke the skill in chat; scripts `extract_materials.py`, `score_topics.py`.
- **Inside**: `SKILL.md`, `scripts/extract_materials.py`, `scripts/score_topics.py`

## ⚡ Installation

### Option A — Clone the whole repo (recommended)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lyanshi795-commits/ai-skills-lab.git
```

Then copy the skills you need:

```bash
# user-wide (all projects)
cp -r ai-skills-lab/skills/<skill-name> ~/.workbuddy/skills/<skill-name>

# or project-scoped
cp -r ai-skills-lab/skills/<skill-name> <your-project>/.workbuddy/skills/<skill-name>
```

### Option B — Download a single skill

From the GitHub file browser, open `skills/<skill-name>/`, download the folder, and drop it into your skill directory. No build step, no network calls at runtime.

> After install, call a skill in chat with its trigger phrase or `/<skill-name>`. Rescan/restart the agent if it doesn't appear immediately.

## 🧬 Anatomy of a skill

Every skill here is a folder + `SKILL.md`. The minimal valid form (from the official spec) needs only `name` and `description`:

```yaml
---
name: my-skill-name
description: What the skill does and when to use it.
---

# My Skill

Instructions the agent follows when this skill is active.
```

A production skill in this repo adds discipline — real example from `long-screenshot-ocr`:

```yaml
---
name: long-screenshot-ocr
description: Extract Chinese/English text from very long screenshot images
  (e.g., mobile scroll captures, course handbooks, chat logs) using slicing,
  upscaling, reading-order reconstruction and noise cleanup. Use this skill when
  the user asks to OCR or extract text from one or more PNG/JPG screenshots.
agent_created: true
---
```

**Frontmatter rules we enforce** (per `agentskills.io` + Anthropic whitepaper):
- `name` — kebab-case, ≤ 64 chars, matches the folder name, no reserved prefixes (`claude`, `anthropic`).
- `description` — must answer **what** + **when** + trigger words, ≤ 1024 chars.
- `license` / `allowed-tools` / `metadata` — declared where relevant (see [compliance](#-standards-compliance)).
- **Body** kept under ~500 lines; long material sinks into `references/`.

---

## 🛠️ Design methodology

Every skill in this repo was built through a benchmarked 4-step loop (no step skipped):

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    S[1 · skill-creator scaffold<br/>correct frontmatter + folder format] --> R[2 · Scrape / search / distill<br/>domain knowledge → references/]
    R --> L[3 · Benchmark local mature skills<br/>dbs-content · yao-demand-skill]
    L --> O[4 · Validate vs official spec<br/>agentskills.io + Anthropic whitepaper]
    O -->|iterate| S
```

**Hard constraints we hold** (from the official sources):
- Progressive disclosure: metadata always resident · body on activation · `references/`/`scripts/` zero-token until needed.
- `SKILL.md` body < 500 lines.
- No `README.md` inside a skill folder (the spec reserves that name).
- **Security**: community skills have a ~26.1% vulnerability rate, and scripted skills are 2.12× riskier than instruction-only — so we audit every bundled file and only trust first-party sources.
